          Sciero’s flagship web app, Bind, is a dynamic antibody and research application manager that connects cellular and molecular biologists with reliable, research-grade antibodies. Researchers can submit good quality antibodies along with critical methodological information. This data then can be interrogated through a rating system by other researchers who are also seeking reliable antibodies for their work.
